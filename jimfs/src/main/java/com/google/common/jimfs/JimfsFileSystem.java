/**
 * {@link FileSystem} implementation for Jimfs. Most behavior for the file system is implemented by
 * its {@linkplain #getDefaultView() default file system view}.
 *
 * <h3>Overview of file system design</h3>
 *
 * {@link com.google.common.jimfs.JimfsFileSystem JimfsFileSystem} instances are created by {@link
 * com.google.common.jimfs.JimfsFileSystems JimfsFileSystems} using a user-provided {@link
 * com.google.common.jimfs.Configuration Configuration}. The configuration is used to create the
 * various classes that implement the file system with the correct settings and to create the file
 * system root directories and working directory. The file system is then used to create the {@code
 * Path} objects that all file system operations use.
 *
 * <p>Once created, the primary entry points to the file system are {@link
 * com.google.common.jimfs.JimfsFileSystemProvider JimfsFileSystemProvider}, which handles calls to
 * methods in {@link java.nio.file.Files}, and {@link
 * com.google.common.jimfs.JimfsSecureDirectoryStream JimfsSecureDirectoryStream}, which provides
 * methods that are similar to those of the file system provider but which treat relative paths as
 * relative to the stream's directory rather than the file system's working directory.
 *
 * <p>The implementation of the methods on both of those classes is handled by the {@link
 * com.google.common.jimfs.FileSystemView FileSystemView} class, which acts as a view of the file
 * system with a specific working directory. The file system provider uses the file system's default
 * view, while each secure directory stream uses a view specific to that stream.
 *
 * <p>File system views make use of the file system's singleton {@link
 * com.google.common.jimfs.JimfsFileStore JimfsFileStore} which handles file creation, storage and
 * attributes. The file store delegates to several other classes to handle each of these:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link com.google.common.jimfs.FileFactory FileFactory} handles creation of new file
 *       objects.
 *   <li>{@link com.google.common.jimfs.HeapDisk HeapDisk} handles allocation of blocks to {@link
 *       RegularFile RegularFile} instances.
 *   <li>{@link com.google.common.jimfs.FileTree FileTree} stores the root of the file hierarchy and
 *       handles file lookup.
 *   <li>{@link com.google.common.jimfs.AttributeService AttributeService} handles file attributes,
 *       using a set of {@link com.google.common.jimfs.AttributeProvider AttributeProvider}
 *       implementations to handle each supported file attribute view.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h3>Paths</h3>
 *
 * The implementation of {@link java.nio.file.Path} for the file system is {@link
 * com.google.common.jimfs.JimfsPath JimfsPath}. Paths are created by a {@link
 * com.google.common.jimfs.PathService PathService} with help from the file system's configured
 * {@link com.google.common.jimfs.PathType PathType}.
 *
 * <p>Paths are made up of {@link com.google.common.jimfs.Name Name} objects, which also serve as
 * the file names in directories. A name has two forms:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>The <b>display form</b> is used in {@code Path} for {@code toString()}. It is also used for
 *       determining the equality and sort order of {@code Path} objects for most file systems.
 *   <li>The <b>canonical form</b> is used for equality of two {@code Name} objects. This affects
 *       the notion of name equality in the file system itself for file lookup. A file system may be
 *       configured to use the canonical form of the name for path equality (a Windows-like file
 *       system configuration does this, as the real Windows file system implementation uses
 *       case-insensitive equality for its path objects.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The canonical form of a name is created by applying a series of {@linkplain PathNormalization
 * normalizations} to the original string. These normalization may be either a Unicode normalization
 * (e.g. NFD) or case folding normalization for case-insensitivity. Normalizations may also be
 * applied to the display form of a name, but this is currently only done for a Mac OS X type
 * configuration.
 *
 * <h3>Files</h3>
 *
 * All files in the file system are an instance of {@link com.google.common.jimfs.File File}. A file
 * object contains both the file's attributes and content.
 *
 * <p>There are three types of files:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link Directory Directory} - contains a table linking file names to {@linkplain
 *       com.google.common.jimfs.DirectoryEntry directory entries}.
 *   <li>{@link RegularFile RegularFile} - an in-memory store for raw bytes.
 *   <li>{@link com.google.common.jimfs.SymbolicLink SymbolicLink} - contains a path.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>{@link com.google.common.jimfs.JimfsFileChannel JimfsFileChannel}, {@link
 * com.google.common.jimfs.JimfsInputStream JimfsInputStream} and {@link
 * com.google.common.jimfs.JimfsOutputStream JimfsOutputStream} implement the standard
 * channel/stream APIs for regular files.
 *
 * <p>{@link com.google.common.jimfs.JimfsSecureDirectoryStream JimfsSecureDirectoryStream} handles
 * reading the entries of a directory. The secure directory stream additionally contains a {@code
 * FileSystemView} with its directory as the working directory, allowing for operations relative to
 * the actual directory file rather than just the path to the file. This allows the operations to
 * continue to work as expected even if the directory is moved.
 *
 * <p>A directory can be watched for changes using the {@link java.nio.file.WatchService}
 * implementation, {@link com.google.common.jimfs.PollingWatchService PollingWatchService}.
 *
 * <h3>Regular files</h3>
 *
 * {@link RegularFile RegularFile} makes use of a singleton {@link com.google.common.jimfs.HeapDisk
 * HeapDisk}. A disk is a resizable factory and cache for fixed size blocks of memory. These blocks
 * are allocated to files as needed and returned to the disk when a file is deleted or truncated.
 * When cached free blocks are available, those blocks are allocated to files first. If more blocks
 * are needed, they are created.
 *
 * <h3>Linking</h3>
 *
 * When a file is mapped to a file name in a directory table, it is <i>linked</i>. Each type of file
 * has different rules governing how it is linked.
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Directory - A directory has two or more links to it. The first is the link from its parent
 *       directory to it. This link is the name of the directory. The second is the <i>self</i> link
 *       (".") which links the directory to itself. The directory may also have any number of
 *       additional <i>parent</i> links ("..") from child directories back to it.
 *   <li>Regular file - A regular file has one link from its parent directory by default. However,
 *       regular files are also allowed to have any number of additional user-created hard links,
 *       from the same directory with different names and/or from other directories with any names.
 *   <li>Symbolic link - A symbolic link can only have one link, from its parent directory.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h3>Thread safety</h3>
 *
 * All file system operations should be safe in a multithreaded environment. The file hierarchy
 * itself is protected by a file system level read-write lock. This ensures safety of all
 * modifications to directory tables as well as atomicity of operations like file moves. Regular
 * files are each protected by a read-write lock which is obtained for each read or write operation.
 * File attributes are protected by synchronization on the file object itself.
